== Frequently Asked Questions ==

If you are using some third-party plugin for caching (WP Super Cache for example) and disable caching for the forum-page, everything should work fine again.

By default only files of the following filetype can be uploaded: jpg, jpeg, gif, png, bmp, pdf. You can modify the allowed filetypes inside the forum administration.

Moderators can be added via the user edit screen in the WordPress administration interface.

[https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/asgaros-forum](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/asgaros-forum).
Please only use this site and dont send me your own .po/.mo files because it is hard to maintain if I get multiple translation-files for a language.
