= I cant see content or modifications I made to the forum =
If you are using some third-party plugin for caching (WP Super Cache for example) and disable caching for the forum-page, everything should work fine again.
= I cant upload my files =
By default only files of the following filetype can be uploaded: jpg, jpeg, gif, png, bmp, pdf. You can modify the allowed filetypes inside the forum administration.
= Where can I add moderators or ban users? =
You can ban users or ad moderators via the user edit screen in the WordPress administration interface.
= How can I show a specific post/topic/forum/category on a page? =
You can extend the shortcodes with different parameters to show specific content only. For example: `[forum post="POSTID"]`, `[forum topic="TOPICID"]`, `[forum forum="FORUMID"]`, `[forum category="CATEGORYID"]` or `[forum category="CATEGORYID1,CATEGORYID2"]`.
= How can I add a captcha to the editor for guests? =
To extend your forum with a captcha you have to use one of the available third-party captcha-plugins for WordPress and extend your themes functions.php file with the checking-logic via the available hooks and filters by your own. For example you can use the plugin [Really Simple CAPTCHA](https://wordpress.org/plugins/really-simple-captcha/) and extend your themes functions.php file with this code:
