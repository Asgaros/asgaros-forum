== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= I cant see new posts/threads or modifications I made to the forum =
If you are using some third-party plugin for caching (WP Super Cache for example) and disable caching for the forum-page, everything should work fine again.
= I cant upload my files =
By default only files of the following filetype can be uploaded: jpg, jpeg, gif, png, bmp, pdf. You can modify the allowed filetypes inside the forum administration.
= Where can I add moderators? =
Moderators can be added via the user edit screen in the WordPress administration interface.
= Where can I ban users? =
Users can be banned via the user edit screen in the WordPress administration interface.
= How can I add a captcha to the editor for guests? =
To extend your forum with a captcha you have to use one of the available third-party captcha-plugins for WordPress and extend your themes functions.php file with the checking-logic via the available hooks and filters by your own. For example you can use the plugin [Really Simple CAPTCHA](https://wordpress.org/plugins/really-simple-captcha/) and extend your themes functions.php file with this code:
[https://gist.github.com/Asgaros/6d4b88b1f5013efb910d9fcd01284698](https://gist.github.com/Asgaros/6d4b88b1f5013efb910d9fcd01284698).
= I want help to translate Asgaros Forum =
You can help to translate Asgaros Forum on this site:
[https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/asgaros-forum](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/asgaros-forum).
Please only use this site and dont send me your own .po/.mo files because it is hard to maintain if I get multiple translation-files for a language.
= Please approve my translations =
You can approve translations by yourself if you are a Project Translation Editor (PTE). Please contact me in the forums if you are a native speaker and want to become a PTE.
= How can I add my own theme? =
You can add own themes for your forum in the `/wp-content/themes-asgarosforum` directory (for example: `/wp-content/themes-asgarosforum/my-theme`). All themes in the `/wp-content/themes-asgarosforum` can be activated in the forum options. Each theme must have at least those files: `style.css`, `mobile.css` and `widgets.css`.
